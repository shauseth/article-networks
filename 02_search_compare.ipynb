      "Abstract: Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has been previously reported in children with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This study reviews our institutional experience by evaluating characteristics and outcomes of children with DVT and staphylococcal infections. Retrospective clinical data from 16 pediatric patients with DVT and staphylococcal infections over a 5-year period was obtained via medical record abstraction. Sixteen patients with a median age at diagnosis of 8 years were included. The most common infection encountered was osteomyelitis (56%). The most common isolated organism was MRSA (63%). Central venous catheters were present in 50% of cases. All patients received anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin except 1 patient with superficial venous thrombosis who was managed conservatively. Fifty percent of patients had complete resolution of DVT by the end of treatment, 25% of the patients had early disappearance of the thrombus at 7 to 10 days. Only 2 patients (12.5%) had persistent thrombus at 6 months. Staphylococcal infections may increase the risk of DVT in children. Therefore, a high index of suspicion for DVT is warranted in children with Staphylococcal infections (particularly MRSA) to promptly diagnose, treat and minimize complications. Prophylactic anticoagulation in presence of staphylococcal infection, particularly MRSA, may be considered in future studies.\n",

      "Abstract: Multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSA (methicillin-resistant) and VRSA (vancomycin-resistant), causes serious healthcare-associated infections, even sepsis and death. Here, we identified six novel cathelicidins (CATHPb1-6) from Python bivittatu, and CATHPb1 displayed the best in vitro pharmacological and toxicological profile. We further show that CATHPb1 exhibited evident protection in mice MRSA/VRSA infection models, given either 24 h before or 4 h after infection. The protection was all effective through different administration routes, but was blocked by in vivo depletion of monocyte/macrophages or neutrophils. CATHPb1 can rapidly and massively modulate macrophages/monocytes and neutrophils trafficking to the infection site, and potentiate their bactericidal functions. Meanwhile, CATHPb1 remarkably augmented neutrophil-mediated bacteria killing by facilitating neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation and preventing its degradation. Acting through MAPKs and NF-κB pathways, CATHPb1 selectively enhanced the levels of chemokines while reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines without undesirable toxicities. The much improved serum half-life and stabilities confer CATHPb1 an excellent prospect to become a novel therapeutic agent against multidrug-resistant staphylococcal infections.\n",

Hospitalized children with staphylococcal infections were identified through the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development discharge database. Infections were categorized as community onset, community onset health care-associated, or hospital onset. Infection incidence was calculated relative to all children and to those hospitalized in acute-care facilities. A total of 140,265 records were analyzed. Overall incidence increased from 49/100,000 population in 1985 to a peak of 83/100,000 in 2006 and dropped to 73/100,000 in 2009. Staphylococcal infections were associated with longer hospital stays and higher risk for death relative to all-cause hospitalizations of children. The number of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections increased, and the number of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus infections remained unchanged. Children <3 years of age, Blacks, and those without private insurance were at higher risk for hospitalization.\n",

      "Abstract: Staphylococcus aureus is a human bacterial pathogen causing a variety of diseases. The occurrence of multidrug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus underlines the need for a vaccine. Defining immune correlates of protection may support the design of an effective vaccine. We used a murine Staphylococcus aureus infection model, in which bacteria were inoculated in an air pouch generated on the back of the animal. Analysis of the air-pouch content in mice immunized or not with an adjuvanted multiantigen vaccine formulation, four-component S. aureus vaccine (4C-Staph), prior to infection allowed us to measure bacteria, cytokines, and 4C-Staph-specific antibodies and to analyze host immune cells recruited to the infection site. Immunization with 4C-Staph resulted in accumulation of antigen-specific antibodies in the pouch and mitigated the infection. Neutrophils were the most abundant cells in the pouch, and they showed the upregulation of Fcγ receptor (FcγR) following immunization with 4C-Staph. Reduction of the infection was also obtained in mice immunized with 4C-Staph and depleted of neutrophils; these mice showed an increase in monocytes and macrophages. Upregulation of the FcγR and the presence of antigen-specific antibodies induced by immunization with 4C-Staph may contribute to increase bacterial opsonophagocytosis. Protection in neutropenic mice indicated that an effective vaccine could activate alternative protection mechanisms compensating for neutropenia, a condition often occurring in S. aureus-infected patients. \n",

      "PMID: 25760338\n",
      "Abstract: The pervasiveness of bacterial resistance to conventional antibiotics, particularly those associated with staphylococcal infections, has become a global epidemic. However, research involving antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and their synthetic analogues has unearthed a potentially novel class of antibacterials for the treatment of an array of diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria, such as staphylococci. AMPs have several unique advantages over traditional antibiotics such as the projected slow emergence of bacterial resistance to these agents and their capability to modulate the host immune response to infection. Unfortunately, their susceptibility to proteolytic degradation, loss of antimicrobial activity due to serum binding or physiological concentration of salts, and toxicity to host tissues has limited their use as systemic agents thus far. Additionally, the presence of economic and regulatory obstacles has hindered the translation of AMPs, as antimicrobials, from the bench to the clinic. The present review delves further into the benefits and challenges of utilizing AMPs as antibacterial agents (particularly for staphylococcal infections), the methods which have been utilized to overcome their limitations, their successes and failures in clinical trials, and future avenues for researchers to pursue to develop AMPs as novel therapeutic allies in the treatment of bacterial infections.\n",

      "Abstract: Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen causing chronic and subclinical mastitis of cows. Autophagy is an important regulatory mechanism that participates in the elimination of invading pathogenic organisms. Here, we hypothesize that autophagy is involved in the process of Staph. aureus survival in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMEC). In this study, we detected the expression of autophagy-related proteins during infection and assessed the effect of autophagosome formation and degradation on the proliferation of intracellular Staph. aureus. Infection with Staph. aureus increased the protein expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (MAP1LC3, also called LC3-II) and sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1, also called p62) in BMEC. After infection, the formation of the autophagosomes increased but the autophagosomes and lysosomes could not fuse normally to form autolysosomes. When the formation of the autophagosomes was enhanced or the degradation of the autolysosomes was inhibited, the number of Staph. aureus in the BMEC increased. However, the intracellular proliferation of Staph. aureus was slowed when formation of autophagosomes was inhibited. Therefore, autophagy was induced in BMEC challenged by Staph. aureus but the autophagic flux was obstructed. Inhibiting the formation of autophagosomes in BMEC facilitated the clearance of intracellular Staph. aureus, which may offer a new strategy for the treatment of mastitis in cows.\n",

      "PMID: 26111644\n",
      "Abstract: Novel antimicrobials and new approaches to developing them are urgently needed. Repurposing already-approved drugs with well-characterized toxicology and pharmacology is a novel way to reduce the time, cost, and risk associated with antibiotic innovation. Ebselen, an organoselenium compound, is known to be clinically safe and has a well-known pharmacology profile. It has shown potent bactericidal activity against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA and VRSA). We demonstrated that ebselen acts through inhibition of protein synthesis and subsequently inhibited toxin production in MRSA. Additionally, ebselen was remarkably active and significantly reduced established staphylococcal biofilms. The therapeutic efficacy of ebselen was evaluated in a mouse model of staphylococcal skin infections. Ebselen 1% and 2% significantly reduced the bacterial load and the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and monocyte chemo attractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in MRSA USA300 skin lesions. Furthermore, it acts synergistically with traditional antimicrobials. This study provides evidence that ebselen has great potential for topical treatment of MRSA skin infections and lays the foundation for further analysis and development of ebselen as a potential treatment for multidrug-resistant staphylococcal infections. \n",

      "Abstract: A rapidly acting, single dose vaccine against Staphylococcus aureus would be highly beneficial for patients scheduled for major surgeries or in intensive care units. Here we show that one immunization with a multicomponent S. aureus candidate vaccine, 4C-Staph, formulated with a novel TLR7-dependent adjuvant, T7-alum, readily protected mice from death and from bacterial dissemination, both in kidney abscess and peritonitis models, outperforming alum-formulated vaccine. This increased efficacy was paralleled by higher vaccine-specific and α-hemolysin-neutralizing antibody titers and Th1/Th17 cell responses. Antibodies played a crucial protective role, as shown by the lack of protection of 4C-Staph/T7-alum vaccine in B-cell-deficient mice and by serum transfer experiments. Depletion of effector CD4+ T cells not only reduced survival but also increased S. aureus load in kidneys of mice immunized with 4C-Staph/T7-alum. The role of IL-17A in the control of bacterial dissemination in 4C-Staph/T7-alum vaccinated mice was indicated by in vivo neutralization experiments. We conclude that single dose 4C-Staph/T7-alum vaccine promptly and efficiently protected mice against S. aureus through the combined actions of antibodies, CD4+ effector T cells, and IL-17A. These data suggest that inclusion of an adjuvant that induces not only fast antibody responses but also IL-17-producing cell-mediated effector responses could efficaciously protect patients scheduled for major surgeries or in intensive care units. \n",

Infections occur notably in permanent carriers of Staphylococcus aureus. To date, all the attempts to develop an efficacious vaccine against S. aureus have failed. Failures in vaccine clinical trials might be related to a focus on single targets and development of humoral-based vaccines rather than vaccines with a combination of antigens stimulating both humoral and cellular immunity. The end points of these unsuccessful trials were a reduction in mortality or bacteremia, whereas the patient's decolonization was not assessed. Adopting the latter point of view, the aim of this article is to discuss nasal mucosal decolonization as a complementary marker of vaccine efficacy for clinical research in vaccine development. \n",

      "Abstract: Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is a major toxic virulence factor secreted by community-acquired methicillin-sensitive or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (SA). SA-PVL can be responsible for life-threatening infections in healthy children with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations involving lung, skin, and soft tissues or bones and joints. PVL production should always be considered in severe SA infections. The pediatric medicine community remains poorly informed regarding the therapeutic management of this infection, which should be early and aggressive. Intravenous empiric antibiotics against SA and its toxins must be given with early and sometimes iterative surgical procedures to drain abscesses and to stop bacterial proliferation and necrosis in the tissues. Here, we report the cases of three patients admitted for SA-PVL infections to the pediatric intensive care unit. Initial clinical presentation in the three patients was multifocal osteomyelitis associated with necrotizing pneumonia; severe skin infection with septic shock; and non-necrotic pneumonia with pleural and pericardial effusion. Appropriate treatments resulted in a good outcome in all cases. Following these illustrations, we describe a number of practical key points in the optimal medical and surgical management of severe SA-PVL infections, with a review of the literature. \n",

      "Abstract: Several studies have demonstrated that the ideal therapeutic effect of linezolid cannot be achieved in critically ill patients with the recommended standard dosing regimen of 600 mg every 12 h (q12h). Moreover, the optimal strategy for successful treatment is still lacking. This study analysed factors influencing the efficacy of linezolid treatment and determined the target for successful treatment by logistic regression in 27 critically ill patients with staphylococcal infection who received linezolid 600 mg q12h. The results showed that only the 24-h area under the concentration-time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC24/MIC) ratio was significantly associated with staphylococcal eradication. Reaching 80% bacterial eradication required an AUC24/MIC of 120.5, defining the therapeutic target. Different dosing regimens were evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation to determine the optimal dosage strategy for linezolid. Although the probability of target attainment (PTA) was high (>99.9%) for the standard dosing regimen at MIC ≤ 1 mg/L, the PTA was almost 0 at MIC = 2 mg/L, thus the dosing regimen required adjustment. In addition, if the dosing regimen was adjusted to 600 mg every 8 h or 600 mg every 6 h, the major staphylococci (except for MRSA and MSSA) exhibited a cumulative fraction of response of >80%, showing a higher treatment success. These findings indicate that a strategy of high linezolid dosage may be needed to increase the probability of successful treatment at MIC > 1 mg/L. The role of therapeutic drug monitoring should be encouraged for optimising linezolid exposure in critically ill patients. \n",
